# Processing-Arduino-Workshop
A series of workshops looking at Processing and how to connect them to Arduino.

In the first part we will be looking at the software Processing, a programming software developed for artists to easily create digital art. Then in the second part we will be connecting it to Arduino to control Processing using an Arduino controller. 

First let's look at some examples that other people have made with Processing.

You can go to:

https://openprocessing.org/browse/#

to have a look at some examples of what you can do with Processing. 



You can also use things like the camera and computer vision as a control as seen in this example.
