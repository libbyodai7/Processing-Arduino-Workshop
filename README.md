# Processing-Arduino Workshop
A series of workshops looking at Processing and how to connect them to Arduino.

In the first part we will be looking at the software Processing, a programming software developed for artists to easily create digital art. Then in the second part we will be connecting it to Arduino to control Processing using an Arduino controller. 

First let's look at some examples that other people have made with Processing.

HAMILY #AM -  Che-Yu Wu 

As well as drawing and animating, using code you can create generative artwork. Notice how in this sketch each person's robots will be different. 

You can also make interactive work:

Brush Drawing 2 - Erin Nicolson

This sketch uses the mouse to generate the drawing.

You can also use things like the camera and computer vision as a control as seen in this example.

SILENT SCREAMER -  jordanne 

Where when you open your mouth "AAA" comes out. 

You can go to:

To see some more examples as well. 

Now we are going to make some sketches of our own!
